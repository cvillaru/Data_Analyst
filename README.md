EMPLOYEE SAMPLE DATA

I have a sample data which I want to present using PowerBI
users can open up dashboard and read any information they want

==  CLEAN

-   I will remove any employees that no longer employees #
-   I will only use those from 2018 to the latest date available in the sample #

==  TRANSFORM

-   I will convert the salary column from $ to Â£
-   I will convert date fromat from "MM/DD/YYYY" to "DD/MM/YYYY"

==  PRESENT

-   I will transfer new data to PowerBI where I will set up charts and graphs
-   make it look nice.
